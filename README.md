# Trees for Public Health

This repo is to develop a strategy to include trees to improve public health. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, knowing that sometimes, the path may lack evidence. Resources, white papers, best-pracices, etc., will also be saved here.

The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US, at about 17% tree cover which is about 3.5 million trees.

Just taking into account trees alone (without looking at climate change, air quality, health or sociodemographics), the Chicago community areas that would benefit the most include:

Highest tree canopy
* Forest Glen 48.72%
* Beverly 44.36%
* North Park 34.61%

Least tree canopy
* Lower West Side 6.91%
* Archer Heights 7.58%
* Armour Square 8.15%
* Near South Side 8.29%
* Near North Side 9.05%
* Clearing 9.22%
* Bridgeport 9.66%
* Near West Side 10%
* Loop 10%
* West Lawn 10.73%
