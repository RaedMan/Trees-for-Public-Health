# Trees for Public Health

This repo is to develop a strategy to include trees to improve public health. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, knowing that sometimes, the path may lack evidence. Resources, white papers, best-pracices, etc., will also be saved here.

While the data and evidence has shown that there is a tree equity disparity in urban canopies, this is not lost on certain communities that are the most vulnerable and suffer most of the effects due to urban heat islands, flooding, air pollution and all that climate change has brought on to their communities, while the known health and environmental benefits of having an urban canopy continues to be unrealized.  The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US.

Just taking into account the urban tree canopy alone, the Chicago community areas are as follows:

* Highest tree canopy
1.  Forest Glen 48.72%
2.  Beverly 44.36%
3.  North Park 34.61%

* Lowest tree canopy
1.  Lower West Side 6.91%
2.  Archer Heights 7.58%
3.  Armour Square 8.15%
4.  Near South Side 8.29%
5.  Near North Side 9.05%
6.  Clearing 9.22%
7.  Bridgeport 9.66%
8.  Near West Side 10%
9.  Loop 10%
10. West Lawn 10.73%
