# Trees for Public Health

This repo is to develop a strategy to include the promotion of conservation and maintenance of the existing urban canopy, planting new trees and sustaining them to improve public health. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, resources, best-practices, etc. to end systemic tree loss. It also serves to accelerate the latest science and innovative porgamming to promote alignment and unification of ad hoc and disparate tree policies across all stakeholders into a cohesive and coordinated approach to tree planting and sustainability of Chicagoâ€™s urban canopy.

While the data and evidence shows that there is a tree equity disparity in urban canopies across the US, this is not lost on communities that already have a small exposure to an urban forest around their neighborhoods. As a result, they may become more vulnerable to urban heat islands, flooding, air pollution, and other climate change effects, and less likely to benefit from the known health and environmental advantages of having a robust urban canopy. The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US.

Just taking into account the urban tree canopy in Chicago:

* Highest tree canopy
1.  Forest Glen 48.72%
2.  Beverly 44.36%
3.  North Park 34.61%

* Lowest tree canopy
1.  Lower West Side 6.91%
2.  Archer Heights 7.58%
3.  Armour Square 8.15%
4.  Near South Side 8.29%
5.  Near North Side 9.05%
6.  Clearing 9.22%
7.  Bridgeport 9.66%
8.  Near West Side 10%
9.  Loop 10%
10. West Lawn 10.73%

Based on the [Chicago Region Trees Initiative Priority Map](https://mortonarb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=0700702eb8fa4c31a4d957d71a09d690).

Through the [Open Air project](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/airquality), prioritizing communities based on sociodemographics, health, air quality, weather, climate, and tree canopy data may better determine the allocation of community building, green corps job training, and tree plantings.

There are several opportunities to pilot passive techniques for air pollution mitigation through green infrastructure to improve the naturally existing urban canopy. Several Chicago community organizations already have existing plans for Chicago's and their neighborhood's urban canopy. We want to borrow from their successes to complement our work and not to replace their plans.

Through discussions with local and national partners, there is an opportunity to obtain urban tree canopy data for this project. The new data set includes tree census and estimation of the canopy density and heights using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The new tools may better assist in the determination of communities with reduced urban canopies that may also have greater needs due to higher chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, high hardship, low child opportunity, and low air quality.

The benefit of piloting tree plantings are multifold and include: promoting and improving physical and mental health, improving social cohesion, reducing stress, increasing property values, reducing energy bills, mitigating climate change, reducing urban heat islands and increasing cooling effects, decreasing soil erosion, storm water management and flood prevention, reducing air pollution, repairing local tree biodiversity, providing critical bird, small animal and essential insect habitats, amongst many other environmental benefits. In the end, this is only accomplished by empowering residents who live in and already maintain their existing trees, and working with them to protect and restore their community trees.
