# Trees for Public Health

This repo is to develop a strategy to include trees to improve public health. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, knowing that sometimes, the path may lack evidence. Resources, white papers, best-pracices, etc., will also be saved here.

The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US, at about 17% tree cover which is about 3.5 million trees.

Highest tree canopy:
1.  Forest Glen/Sauganash 48.72%
2.  Beverly 44.36%
3.  North Park 34.61%

Least tree canopy:
1. Lower West Side 6.91%
2. Loop 10%
3. Near South Side 8.29%
4. Near North Side 9.05%

Community areas that would benefit the most include:
1. Armour Square
2. Burnside
3. Fuller Park
4. West Garfield Park
5. Englewood
