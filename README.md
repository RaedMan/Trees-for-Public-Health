# Trees for Public Health

This repo is to develop a strategy to include trees to help improve public health. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, resources, best-pracices, etc.

While the data and evidence shows that there is a tree equity disparity in urban canopies across the US, this is not lost on communities that already have a small exposure to an urban forest around their neighborhoods. As a result, they may become more vulnerable to urban heat islands, flooding, air pollution, and other climate change effects, and less likely to benefit from the known health and environmental advantages of having a robust urban canopy.  The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US.

Just taking into account the urban tree canopy in Chicago:

* Highest tree canopy
1.  Forest Glen 48.72%
2.  Beverly 44.36%
3.  North Park 34.61%

* Lowest tree canopy
1.  Lower West Side 6.91%
2.  Archer Heights 7.58%
3.  Armour Square 8.15%
4.  Near South Side 8.29%
5.  Near North Side 9.05%
6.  Clearing 9.22%
7.  Bridgeport 9.66%
8.  Near West Side 10%
9.  Loop 10%
10. West Lawn 10.73%

Based on the [Chicago Region Trees Initiative Priority Map](https://mortonarb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=0700702eb8fa4c31a4d957d71a09d690).

Through the [Open Air project](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/airquality), prioritizing communities based on sociodemographics, health, air quality, weather, climate, and tree canopy data may better determine the allocation of community building, green corps job training, and tree plantings.

There are several opportunities to pilot passive techniques for air pollution mitigation through green infrastructure to improving the urban canopy. Through current discussions with potential partners to share data across different sectors, opportunities may be present to discover  communities with reduced green infrastructures. Through discussions with local and national partners, there is an opportunity to share urban tree canopy data for this project. New data sets includes tree census and estimation of the canopy density and heights using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The benefit of piloting tree planting are multifold and ranges from promoting and improving physical and mental health, improved social cohesion, reducing stress, increasing property values, reducing energy bills, mitigating climate change, reducing urban heat islands and increasing cooling effects, decrease soil erosion, storm water management and flood prevention and reducing air pollution, amongst several other benefits.
