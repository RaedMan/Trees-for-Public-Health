# Trees for Public Health

This repo was created on July 19, 2019 to develop a public health strategy to improve Chicago's urban canopy using a health equity lens through planting new trees, maintining the existing trees, improving communication, and providing workforce development and job training. At first, this will be a scan of the environment for evidence-based research, resources, best-practices, etc. It also serves to accelerate the latest science and innovative porgamming to promote alignment and unification of ad hoc and disparate tree initiatives across all stakeholders into a cohesive and coordinated approach to tree planting and sustainability of Chicagoâ€™s urban canopy by prioritizing vulnerable communities.

While the data and evidence shows that there is a tree equity disparity in urban canopies across the US, this is not lost on communities that already have a small exposure to an urban forest around their neighborhoods. As a result, they may become more vulnerable to urban heat islands, flooding, air pollution, and other climate change effects, and less likely to benefit from the known health and environmental advantages of having a robust urban canopy. The latest research by CRTI shows that Chicago has one of the smallest urban canopies of any big city in the US, based on 2010 data from the [Chicago Region Trees Initiative Priority Map](https://mortonarb.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=0700702eb8fa4c31a4d957d71a09d690).

Prioritizing communities based on sociodemographics, health, air quality, weather, climate, and tree canopy data may better determine the allocation of community building, green corps job training, and tree plantings. Several Chicago community organizations already have existing plans for Chicago's and their neighborhood's urban canopy. We want to borrow from their successes to complement our work and not to replace their plans.

Through discussions with local and national partners, there is an opportunity to obtain urban tree canopy data for this project. The new data set includes tree census and estimation of the canopy density and heights using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). These new tools may better assist in the determination of communities with reduced urban canopies that may also have greater needs due to higher chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, high hardship, low child opportunity, and low air quality.

The benefit of trees are multifold and include: promoting and improving physical and mental health, improving social cohesion, reducing stress, increasing property values, reducing energy bills, mitigating climate change, reducing urban heat islands and increasing cooling effects, decreasing soil erosion, storm water management and flood prevention, reducing air pollution, repairing local tree biodiversity, providing critical bird, small animal and essential insect habitats, amongst many other environmental benefits. In the end, this is only accomplished by empowering residents who live in and already maintain their existing trees, and working with them to protect and restore their community trees.
